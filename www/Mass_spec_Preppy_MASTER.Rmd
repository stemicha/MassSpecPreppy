# Protocol step 2 -  SP3 digest - steps

<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Always perform labware calibration before starting this protocol at the OT-2 app</span>

**please provide WITHOUT AIR BUBBLES:**

- 95% acetonitril (ACN) >> waste will be collected in A11 and A12 position of reagent plate (!!! proper disposal of  ACN !!!)
- 80% ethanol (EtOH)
- digest buffer (50mM Tris/HCl 1mM CaCl~2~ pH8 at 37°C >> this means pH 8.3 at 25°C; must be very accurate !!!)
- `r params$LysC_stock_concentration` ng/µl LysC stock solution in H~2~O (add in reagent plate before starting the protocol)
- `r params$trypsin_stock_concentration` ng/µl trypsin stock solution in 50mM acetic acid (add in reagent plate after 3h LysC incubation)
- `r params$LysC_Trypsin_Mix_concentration` ng/µl LysC/Trypsin Mix stock solution in 50mM acetic acid
