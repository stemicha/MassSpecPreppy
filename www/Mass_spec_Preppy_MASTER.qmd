# Things to pay attention

::: {.callout-caution}
## Thrash fill level:

Always watch fill level of thrash. If thrash is full please click on "pause" empty trash and click "resume".
:::

::: {.callout-important}

Always perform labware calibration before starting a protocol at the OT-2 app !

# Protocol step 1 - sample preparation

::: {.callout-important}

## please provide WITHOUT AIR BUBBLES:

- 1x sample buffer
- 12.5mM DTT in water (freshly prepared) *[only when reduction and alkylation is being used]*
- 50mM IAA in water (freshly prepared, MUST BE KEPT DARK) *[only when reduction and alkylation is being used]*
- 50µg/µl SP3 beads (mix of hyrdophilic and hydrophobic beads)
:::


> during the alkylation using the OT-2 robot it should be protected from light as much as possible ! (iodoacetamide are extremely light-sensitive)

## please provide WITHOUT AIR BUBBLES:

- 95% acetonitril (ACN) >> waste will be collected in A11 and A12 position of reagent plate (!!! proper disposal of  ACN !!!)
- 80% ethanol (EtOH)
- digest buffer (50mM Tris/HCl 1mM CaCl~2~ pH8 at 37°C >> this means pH 8.3 at 25°C; must be very accurate !!!)

- incubation at 37°C (e.g. inside an incubator) should be performed with MixMate at 1500rpm
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## ACN waste disposal

The ACN waste is collected in the reagent NEST 12-Well reservoirs at position 11,12. Please ensure the correct disposal of ACN waste after the OT-2 run is completed!
