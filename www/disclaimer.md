Use of the app and the files it generates is without any guarantee.

Insofar as the University obtains consent from the data subject for the collection of personal data, Article 6 (1) lit. a DS-GVO serves as the legal basis.
If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of the University and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f DS-GVO serves as the legal basis for the processing.
