### 1. Sample list template

Download the sample template using the download button in the upper left
corner of the app.

Open the Excel template and edit the form.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 30%" />
<col style="width: 70%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>table column</th>
<th>explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>sample</em></td>
<td>name of your sample</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>protein concentration (µg/µl)</em></td>
<td>determined protein concentration of sample</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>OT-2 slot</em></td>
<td>OT-2 slot were the sample is standing (max N = 4)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>OT-2 position</em></td>
<td>OT-2 position inside the slot (max N = 24)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em>volume</em></td>
<td>sample volume inside the sample tube (essential for liquid height
function)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em>preparation plate position</em></td>
<td>the position in the preparation plate (leave as it is !)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**IF YOU DO NOT SPECIFY THE SAMPLE NAME ALL OTHER INFORMATION IN THE
ROWS ARE NEGLECTED !**

#### Sample volume

Sample volume is set by the user in the table. However, all volumes
below 60µl were taken out with 0.5mm distance from the bottom.

### 2. Parameters

Just select the desired parameters like enzyme:protein ratio etc.

**ADVICE: Use the calculated concentrations since they are optimized for
adding always 2µl of enzyme to the sample !**

### 3. Processing and Download

After processing you can download the OT-2 protocols and decklayouts
etc.

The downloaded zip-folder contains the decklayout plots and the python
scripts for the OT-2.
