These are the screw positions where the new magnet plate you manufactured has holes.

This prevents bead carryover, which is extremely important. In contrast to the supplied magnets which localizes the bead pellet rod-shaped to the bottom of the reaction vessel wall and a carry-over of beads is likely.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: self-made magnetic plate bead localization"

For example, a human plasma sample (approx. 70-80 µg/µl) should be initially 50-fold diluted, and a 40-fold dilution should be used in the BCA assay to have read-outs in the linear range of the standard curve.\nIf you cannot estimate the protein concentration use multiple dilutions per sample. You can edit the BCA assay template excel file for that purpose to have e.g. a 30fold, 50fold and 80fold dilution of your sample. Be aware of the correct entries in OT-2 slot & OT-2 postion column when using multiple dilutions per sample.
